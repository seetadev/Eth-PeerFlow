# üåê **Eth PeerFlow**

### *Decentralized Emergency Coordination and Payment Network using PyUSD | Hedera | Hardhat v3 | libp2p | Filecoin | Ethereum*

---

## üß≠ Overview

**Eth PeerFlow** is a multi-chain, trustless coordination network that connects **emergency responders, healthcare providers, and TPAs (Third-Party Administrators)** through decentralized communication, verified incident reporting, and programmable payments.

When centralized systems fail ‚Äî servers crash, APIs throttle, or banks freeze ‚Äî **Eth PeerFlow** keeps coordination alive via **py-libp2p peer-to-peer networking**, **Hedera smart contracts**, and **PayPal USD (PyUSD)** stablecoin payments.

> üß© Built with: **Hardhat v3 + Hedera + PyUSD + libp2p + Filecoin/IPFS**

## üö® Problem

* **Centralized systems collapse under pressure** ‚Üí outages and throttled APIs halt communication.
* **Medical billing and coordination are slow** ‚Üí manual approvals and intermediaries delay care.
* **Trust and transparency are missing** ‚Üí no verifiable record of responders or fund transfers.
* **No resilient alternative exists** ‚Üí emergency networks cannot stay online under real-world stress.

---

## üí° Solution

**Eth PeerFlow** is a **decentralized, trustless communication and payment layer** for emergency coordination.

* **Peer-to-Peer Coordination:** Built on **py-libp2p** for resilient, censorship-resistant messaging.
* **Programmable Payments:** Smart contracts on **Ethereum + Hardhat v3** manage billing and disbursements.
* **Stable, Borderless Finance:** **PayPal USD (PyUSD)** and **Hedera tokens** enable instant, low-fee payments.
* **Cross-Chain Verifiability:** Anchors proofs and invoices across **Filecoin/IPFS** for permanence and auditability.

## üß© System Architecture

**1Ô∏è‚É£ P2P Communication (py-libp2p)**
Resilient mesh for hospitals, responders, and TPAs ‚Äî operates even when cloud APIs fail.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Decentralized Storage (Filecoin + IPFS)**
Incident data, proofs, and invoices are stored immutably with IPFS CIDs.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contracts (Hardhat v3 + ERC-20)**
Implements `PPT Token` and `InvoiceManager` for trustless settlements.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Stable Payments (PyUSD + Hedera)**
Instant PyUSD or Hedera-token payouts ensure predictable, real-world value.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Verification & Auditability**
Every coordination event is timestamped, signed, and verifiable across **Ethereum**, **Filecoin**, and **Hedera**.

## üß† How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Emergency occurs.** Centralized networks fail.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Peers connect.** Responders auto-link through py-libp2p mesh.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Incidents logged.** Data stored immutably on Filecoin/IPFS.
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Payments flow.** Smart contracts trigger PyUSD/Hedera disbursements.
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Transparency ensured.** Every action is verifiable across chains.
