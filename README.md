# Eth PeerFlow

**Py-libp2p Mesh Orchestration Layer for Commerce & DeFi**

EthPeerFlow is a Python-based peer-to-peer (P2P) mesh network designed for decentralized commerce and DeFi applications. Built on top of **py-libp2p**, it allows Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, tokenized assets, and off-chain commerce systems to communicate in a secure, modular, and extensible P2P network.

EthPeerFlow enables developers to orchestrate decentralized mesh networks that handle peer discovery, transaction propagation, and tokenized asset exchanges with low-latency, fault-tolerant connectivity.

## üöÄ Features

* **Decentralized P2P Mesh:** Built with py-libp2p for reliable peer discovery, messaging, and routing.
* **Ethereum & DeFi Integration:** Seamless interaction with Ethereum smart contracts for tokenized payments, escrow, and on-chain logic.
* **Stablecoin Support:** Supports PyUSD for off-chain commerce settlements and stable-value transfers.
* **Cross-Ledger Orchestration:** Integration with Hedera Hashgraph and other partner protocols for hybrid DLT interoperability.
* **Secure & Modular:** End-to-end encryption of messages, pluggable transport layers (TCP, QUIC, WebRTC), and modular discovery mechanisms.
* **Extensible for Commerce & DeFi Apps:** Ideal for decentralized marketplaces, DeFi applications, and real-time P2P payment channels.

## üíª How It‚Äôs Made

EthPeerFlow is a Python project built with a focus on modularity, interoperability, and real-world usability in decentralized commerce:

1. **Core Networking:**

   * **py-libp2p** forms the backbone of the mesh network.
   * Supports QUIC, TCP, and WebRTC transports for flexible deployment scenarios.
   * Implements Gossipsub v1.1 for efficient pub-sub messaging and peer scoring.

2. **Smart Contract Integration:**

   * Connects to Ethereum via **web3.py** to handle smart contract interactions.
   * Facilitates token swaps, escrow transactions, and DeFi logic on-chain.

3. **Partner Protocols:**

   * **PyUSD:** Enables stablecoin settlements for commerce use-cases.
   * **Hedera:** Cross-ledger interoperability for high-throughput payment channels.
   * Other partners provide off-chain or hybrid services that plug directly into the network.

4. **Orchestration Layer:**

   * EthPeerFlow orchestrates P2P connections, manages mesh topology, and abstracts away low-level network complexity.
   * Includes automated peer discovery, retries, and topology optimization for commercial-grade reliability.

5. **Hacky/Notable Implementations:**

   * Custom stream lifecycle tracking for robust handling of network partitions and reconnects.
   * Dynamic transport switching: peers can swap QUIC, TCP, or WebRTC transport at runtime without disrupting ongoing transactions.
   * Modular discovery allows integration with both DHT-based peer-finding (BitTorrent DHT) and enterprise partner-specific discovery services.
