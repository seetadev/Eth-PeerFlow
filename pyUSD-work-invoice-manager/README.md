Eth PeerFlow uses PayPal USD (PyUSD) as the trusted financial layer for emergency healthcare, medical billing, and counseling coordination on decentralized infrastructure. During crises where centralized networks fail, our peer-to-peer mesh (Py-libp2p) allows hospitals, patients, and insurers (TPAs) to communicate, verify incidents, and settle payments instantly and transparently using PyUSD stablecoin.

By integrating PyUSD smart contracts on Ethereum (via Hardhat v3), Eth PeerFlow ensures:

Predictable, low-volatility payments for medical aid and counseling services.

Automated, on-chain invoice verification and insurance reimbursements.

Cross-border accessibility, enabling humanitarian payouts and tele-counseling without reliance on banking rails.

Our system demonstrates how PyUSD can serve as a universal, programmable healthcare settlement layer, bridging emergency coordination, digital identity, and stablecoin-powered finance â€” a real-world example of financial stability meeting decentralized impact.
