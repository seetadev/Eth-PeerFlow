# 🧭 Eth PeerFlow — Verifiable Emergency Coordination on Hedera

**Eth PeerFlow** leverages **Hedera Hashgraph** to bring **verifiable trust, transparency, and auditability** to decentralized emergency coordination.
In crisis scenarios where traditional communication and payment systems may fail, Eth PeerFlow empowers responders, hospitals, and TPAs to **log, verify, and reward emergency actions** on **Hedera’s fast, low-cost, and energy-efficient network**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Within our architecture, **Hedera Smart Contracts** are used to:

* 📍 **Record** verified emergency incidents submitted by citizens and responders.
* 🏅 **Automate** reputation scoring and distribute tokenized rewards to verified participants.
* 🔗 **Anchor** cross-chain proofs for invoices and incident data from **Ethereum** and **Filecoin**, ensuring interoperability across networks.

Hedera’s **governance transparency**, **finality guarantees**, and **public consensus service** make it ideal for maintaining a **tamper-proof humanitarian registry** — where every report, verification, and reward is **publicly auditable yet privacy-respecting**.
