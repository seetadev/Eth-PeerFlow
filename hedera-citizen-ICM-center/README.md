Eth PeerFlow leverages Hedera Hashgraph to bring verifiable trust, transparency, and auditability to decentralized emergency coordination. In crisis scenarios where communication and payment systems collapse, Eth PeerFlow enables responders, hospitals, and TPAs to log, verify, and reward emergency actions through Hedera’s fast, low-cost, and energy-efficient network.

Within our architecture, Hedera Smart Contracts are used to:

Record verified emergency incidents submitted by citizens and responders.

Automate reputation scoring and distribute tokenized rewards to verified participants.

Anchor cross-chain proofs for invoices and incident data from Ethereum and Filecoin.

Hedera’s governance transparency, finality guarantees, and public consensus service make it ideal for maintaining a tamper-proof humanitarian registry — where every report, verification, and reward is publicly auditable yet privacy-respecting.
